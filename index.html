    <p>I attended Saint Louis University (SLU) from 1994-1998.
      I entered as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy">Physical Therapy major</a>.
        SLU's liberal arts curriculum required me to take several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Philosophy</a> classes.
           I really enjoyed the amount and kind of thinking required in Philosophy classes, and decided to get a philosophy minor.
           But during my junior year, I became disallusioned with many of the Physical Therapy classes. They emphasized rote
           memorization, with hardly any critical or creative thinking. I decided break from physical therapy and
           to cram the classes necessary for a philosophy degree into my senior year. After doing that, I was encouraged to apply
           to graduate school by the Philosophy Department Chair. I did and got into the <a href="http://www.uc.edu">University of Cincinnati&#39s</a>
             MA program. I had applied to more than a dozen schools, but UC was the only one that accepted me!</p>

    <p>I entered UC in 1998 and graduated in 2001. Based on my undergraduate training, I thought I would concentrate
      in either ancient philosophy or ethics. To really work on ancient philosophy would have required learning Ancient Greek,
      which was a bit of a barrier. Additionally, I was captivated by the idea that if we figured out what justice required, everyone might
      agree about what we need to do to make our society more just. Unfortuantely, I hadn't taken any political philosophy courses as an undergraduate,
      so there was a lot of catching up to do! I was learning a lot more about how to better argue and about recent work in political philosophy.
      As it turned out, though, the paper that I used to apply to PhD programs was on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/">Paul Feyerabend&#39s</a>
      work on <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/">incommensurability</a>, the idea that new scientific theories may use concepts and methods
      that represent such a break from older scientific theories that the transition between the two may not be fully rational. This time, I was a much better prepared
      student and I got into all three schools I applied to, ultimately deciding on <a href="http://osu.edu">The Ohio State University</a>.</p>

    <p>I didn't continue working directly on philosophy of science or political philosophy at OSU. Instead, I ended up focusing on
      moral responsibility: the concept connected to blaming, praising, punishing, and rewarding other people. Roughly, the idea is that
      it doesn't seem appropriate to blame, punish, etc someone unless she is morally responsible for what she&#39s done. That much seems (relatively) clear.
      But there are lots of puzzles and difficulties! The one that I focused on in my disseration is what&#39s known as the problem of manipulation.
      Suppose that nefarious neuroscientists were able to control someone&#39s brain in a very subtle way, so that they could make that person
      do whatever the neuroscientists wanted. But at the same time, the person would <em>want</em> to do whatever the
      neuroscientists wanted! Suppose the neuroscientists want to make Zac insult Joe. Well, then it will occur to
      Zac that insulting Joe is an awesome idea and Zac will insult Joe on purpose. Zac will probably even then feel
      satisfied with himself!</p>
    <p>What should we make of this situation? Well, you might think that because of what
      the neuroscientists did, Zac <em>isn&#39t</em> morally responsible for insulting Joe. So Joe shouldn't blame Zac.
      But if that&#39s right, we should ask why Zac isn't morally responsible for what he did. Is it because his actions
      were caused by factors (what the neuroscientits did) that were out of his control? Well, if that's right, then
      maybe none of us are <em>ever</em> morally responsible for what we did! Because all of our actions are ultimately
      caused by other things (our genes, upbringing, what other people do, etc.) that aren't in our control.
    <p>People that agree with this reasoning are hard determinists: they think that if all of our actions are
      really determined by things out of our control then none of us can ever be morally responsible for what we do.
      I actually think this is wrong and, in my disseration, I tried to explain why. Very quickly, my idea is that
      we think it would be <em>unfair</em> to blame Zac in this situation because there&#39s anohter party
      --the Neuroscientists--who it seems we should blame instead. Because the Neuroscientists intentionally caused
      Zac to do what he did, we should blame them! But in almost every regular case, no one is intentionally
      messing with our brains to make us do what we do.</p>
    <p>Anyway, that got kind of longwinded! Sorry about that. (I'd be happy to chat more, if you're interested.)
      The important bit is that I finished my PhD in 2010 and was hired at
      <a href="http://www.nmu.edu">Northern Michigan University</a>.</p>

    <p>I really enjoy my work at NMU. My students are excellent, I have some great colleagues, and the university
      has been really good to me. The setting of NMU is lovely (right on the shores of Lake Superior).
      I&#39m on sabbatical this year and my partner and I came to St. Louis to work and see friends.
      (We have lots of friends here from my college days.) I can't remember how, but we discovered LaunchCode.
      And, actually, we&#39re both doing it. She starts next week!</p>
